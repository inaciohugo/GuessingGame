<h1> The Guessing Game 🎲</h1>


#### A game with the proposal to make the player guess a number between 0 and 10.
#### I used HTML, CSS and learned a little more about JavaScript as using objects to perform events and the link between HTML and JavaScript by the DOM (Document Object Model).

### This project focuses on learning to:
+ DOM manipulation
+ preventStandard
+ operators
+ innerText property
+ check classes with alternation
